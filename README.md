# Pedagogical-Tracer-Box-Model

MATLAB code for a nine box model of the meridional ocean overturning circulation. The model computes tracer concentrations and related Green's function transport diagnostics, like transit-time distributions.

The model is based on [Haine & Hall (2002)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/32/6/1520-0485_2002_032_1932_agttwm_2.0.co_2.xml) and adapted and extended for the review paper by (Haine et al. (in prep.))[]

Run the model with the `Tracer_diagnostics_illustration.mlx` LiveScript.

To run the random walk residence time distribution computation use `make_random_walk_RTD.m`.
